            <h3>Create Relevant Content</h3>
            <p>You’ll be posting loads of engaging content, so be sure to keep your blog <br>
            organized with Categories that also allow readers to explore more of what <br>
            interests them. Each category of your blog has its own page that’s fully <br>
            customizable. Add a catchy title, a brief description and a beautiful image to the <br>
            category page header to truly make it your own. You can also add tags (#vacation <br>
            #dream #summer) throughout your posts to reach more people, and help readers <br>
            search for relevant content. Using hashtags can expand your post reach and help <br>
            people find the content that matters to them. Go ahead, #hashtag away.</p>
            <h4>Stun Your Readers </h4>
            <p><i>“Be original, show off your style, and tell your story.”</i></p>
            <p>Blogging gives your site a voice, so let your business’ personality shine through. <br>
            Are you a creative agency? Go wild with original blog posts about recent projects, <br>
            cool inspirational ideas, or what your company culture is like. Add images, and <br>
            videos to really spice it up, and pepper it with slang to keep readers interested. <br>
            Are you a programmer? Stay on the more technical side by offering weekly tips, <br>
            tricks, and hacks that show off your knowledge of the industry. No matter what <br>
            type of business you have, one thing is for sure - blogging gives your business the <br>
            opportunity to be heard in a way in a different and unconventional way.  </p>
